# Unreachable Code in Julia
This repository demonstrates an example of unreachable code in a Julia function. The `return x + 1` statement is unreachable because the `if/elseif/else` block covers all possibilities.

The `bug.jl` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.jl` file demonstrates the correction.
